**Front end with react and backend Node.js Express server (currently mocked)**

how to set up the app:
1. navigate into the client folder
2. in cli enter 'npm install', this will install all the packages needed for the front-end, will need to have node.js installed (see: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
3. in cli now type and enter 'npm start'


When interacting with the app, as this is a mobile app that is replicated on browser:
- right click page and press inspect, on the top of the page select the drop down and select any phone
dimensions for the full app experience.
